**Approach 1 =>** use array of size 100 , as question constraint
then return arr[len/2]
* len can also be calculated  in same , when we are inserting element n array
**Approach 2 ->** using slow and fast pointer .
if two person a, b have to cover distance d , with speed x and 2x respectively.
so, so when b cober distance d in time t,
at the same momment a cover distance d/1 in time t
